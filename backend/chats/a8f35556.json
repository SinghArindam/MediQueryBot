      "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user asked, \"What is diabetes?\" I need to explain diabetes clearly. Let me start by defining it. I should mention the two main types: Type 1 and Type 2. For Type 1, it's when the body can't make enough insulin, which is why people need insulin. For Type 2, the body doesn't respond well to insulin, so it needs more. I should also talk about the symptoms, like frequent urination, weight loss, and fatigue. It's important to mention that diabetes can be managed with diet, exercise, and medication. I should end by emphasizing that this information is educational and not a substitute for professional advice.\n</think>\n\nDiabetes is a health condition where the body cannot produce enough insulin, a hormone that helps regulate blood sugar levels. There are two main types: Type 1 (where the body loses insulin production) and Type 2 (where the body doesn't respond well to insulin). \n\n**Symptoms** often include frequent urination, extreme thirst, unexplained weight loss, and fatigue. **Management** typically involves diet, exercise, and medication.
